## How to Customize Your Information

There are two ways to update the signature with your personal details (Name, Title, Phone).

### Edit Directly in Outlook
1.  **Open** the `.html` file in your web browser.
2.  **Copy** the signature (Press `Ctrl+A` then `Ctrl+C`).
3.  Go to Outlook **Settings** > **Signatures**.
4.  **Paste** (`Ctrl+V`) the signature into the box.
5.  **Edit** the text directly inside the Outlook signature editor. 
    > [!NOTE]
    > Outlook's editor can sometimes be finicky with spacing and removing styles. It is best to not remove entire lines of text without adding your own.

## Mobile Optimization
The signatures have been optimized for mobile display with:
- **Reduced Spacing**: Vertical gaps between elements have been reduced by 50% for a more compact feel.
- **Refined Typography**: Font sizes and line heights have been adjusted to ensure clarity on smaller screens while maintaining professional aesthetics.
- **Fixed Width**: The 520px container remains to ensure consistent rendering across email clients.
